# Vision based Multi degree of freedom serial Manipulator for the patients suffering from Neurological disorders and infectious diseases (COVID-19)

- The robotic arm aims to provide empathetic feeding support to aged patients suffering from various neurological disorders and hand amputees. 
- The setup comprises two bowls: one containing Dal (Indian lentil soup), curry, or curd, and the other containing rice or khichdi. The robot collects the liquid food from the first bowl, mixes it into the second bowl, and delivers the prepared mixture to the user via a pre-planned, smooth trajectory. Upon completing each feeding cycle, the arm returns to its designated home position.

## Problem Statement

Elderly individuals in senior care facilities often face challenges with their caretakers, particularly in relation to daily meal consumption. This has a tremendous effect on their mental health and dents their self-dignity. This indicates a demand for automated or intelligent feeding aid systems to enhance the self-autonomy of the patients in their regular meal consumption.

## My Role

- Designed a 6-DOF robotic arm in SolidWorks and fabricated it using the Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) additive manufacturing technique.

- Performed forward and inverse kinematic analysis using Peter Corkeâ€™s Robotics System Toolbox in MATLAB.

- Planned and optimized smooth motion trajectories to ensure precise food delivery with minimal spillage.

- Contributed to patent drafting and co-authored a research publication.

## Achievement/Recognition

- Honored with the **WAAH Senior Science Laureate Award 2023** for the invention of the robotic arm.
